# Classifying-shoulder-implants-in-X-ray-images
Images were collected by Maya Stark at BIDAL Lab at SFSU for her MS thesis project. They are from The UW Shoulder Site, manufacturer websites, and Feeley Lab at UCSF. The original collection included 605 X-ray images. Eight images that appeared to have been taken from the same patients were removed, resulting in the final 597 images. The final set contains images from the following manufacturers: 83 from Cofield, 294 from Depuy, 71 from Tornier, and 149 from Zimmer, resulting in a 4-class classification problem. Class labels are provided as the manufacturer name in file names
